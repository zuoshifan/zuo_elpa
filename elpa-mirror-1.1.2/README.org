* elpa-mirror (version 1.1.2)
Set up ELPA mirror from locally installed packages is easy.

It will create everything you need (web files, pakcages, archive-contents) for hosting a ELPA mirror site. Only locally installed packages will be included.

So you basically lock up your packages.

* Why use elpa-mirror
- Packages are locked. You control all your packages. No package dependency hell!
- Hosting your own ELPA site has *ZERO* cost. You only need an email and some free cloud service like Dropbox.
- Web files are optimized manually. So the web traffic is minimum.
- The web site supports both mobile and desktop.

* Install
elpa-mirror is already uploaded to [[http://marmalade-repo.org/]]. The best way to install it is using Emacs' package manager.

Or you can download the package from [[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/858862/myelpa/index.html]] and manually install it by "M-x package-install-file".
* Set up
Nothing to set up.

* Usage
Just "M-x elpamr-create-mirror-for-installed". That's the only command!

All files needed to host ELPA site will be output into user specified directory. Say it's "~/myelpa".

* Download packages from your own ELPA
You can use local file path, insert below code into your .emacs:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# Now elpa/marmalade/melpa site will be overrided
(setq package-archives '(("myelpa" . "~/myelpa")))
#+END_SRC

All you can upload everything into any web server or cloud service, insert below code into .emacs:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# all-to-list will not override default elpa, so now you have to repositories, one is elpa, another is myelpa
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("myelpa" . "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/858862/myelpa/"))
#+END_SRC

* Tips (OPTIONAL)
You can tweak the content of index.html a little bit.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; default output directory
(setq elpamr-default-output-directory "~/myelpa")

;; displayed in sample code of index.html
(setq elpamr-repository-name "myelpa")

;; displayed in sample code of index.html
(setq elpamr-repository-path "http://myelpa.mydomain.com")

;; contact email, displayed in index.html
(setq elpamr-email "myname@gmail.com")

;; when exporting installed packages, ignore packages from these repositories
;; "gnu" means packages hosted on http://elpa.gnu.org
;; "melpa" means packages hosted on http://melpa.milkbox.net
(setq elpamr-exclude-package-from-repositories '("myelpa" "gnu" "melpa"))
#+END_SRC
